Hello, this is Hengfei. I am a Visiting fellow at School of Mathematics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (Mumbai) from September 2017, working with Professor Dipendra Prasad. Under the supervision of Professor Wee Teck Gan, I finished my Ph.D. study at Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore. I am interested in the local Langlands correspondence.
